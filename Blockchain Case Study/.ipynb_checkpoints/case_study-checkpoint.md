# Case Study Proposal: Ledn

## What Is It

Ledn is a Toronto-based bitcoin lending and saving company. Ledn was built to close a gap for financial services in the digital asset space. Ledn is offered in over 100 countries of interest-paying savings accounts for bitcoin and USDC, as well as bitcoin-backed loans that provide borrowers with access to fiat or the opportunity to buy more bitcoin. In general, Ledn has 3 products: Borrow - bitcoin-backed loans that allow you to borrow against your bitcoin holdings (without selling your bitcoin!), Save - an interest account that pays interest in bitcoin on bitcoin, and B2X - a service that allows you to double your bitcoin holdings through tying together the purchase of bitcoin with a Ledn loan. 

## Why This Matters

The majority of the planet does not have access to basic financial services. Finance has been the number one limiting factor for the majority of the world's people. Many people do not have access to stable currencies and assets. These people, therefore, are unable to save, invest and to grow. Ledn is in the project to offer equal opportunties to finance for these communities.

To achieve this, Ledn thinks that Bitcoin can fix this. By combining Bitcoin and financial services,  there is an opportunity for bitcoin to serve as the world's best collateral. Ledn is characterized by its international presence. The site is focused on offering multiple languages. Its international focus gives Ledn and edge because it is focused on a more decentralized cohort of people. 

## Why This May be Interesting

In 2019, besides offers bitcoin-backed fiat loans, now also offers dollar-pegged DAI loans, connecting bitcoin users with ethereumâ€™s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ledn will buy ethereum-backed DAI from over-the-counter traders and manage bitcoin custody for loan clients. This will enable the company to offer its service to places where currencies are instable with hyperinflation for example. Services like this can help rebuild economy and livelihood of many communities.
